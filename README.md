# CS271 - Oregon State University
## Wyatt D. Whiting

I took this course in Fall 2020 at Oregon State University, taught by grad student Jian Tang. We had weekly programming assignments which were implemented in `masm`, as well as weekly worksheets that were intended to reinforce our understanding of concepts used in assembly programming. This repo will contain the source code that made up the weekly assignments. The programs require the extra support of the `Irvine` libraries, which came from the textbook author we used. A google search can lead you to these.

This class was quite irritating, unfortunately. We students did not receive a huge amount of support throughout. Although this may have been a blessing in disguise, as I was forced to develop a decent understanding of assembly programming. 

The final, in particular, was horrendous. Our instructor came up with an assignment on his own that required us to compile the Lua libraries ourselves. This on it's own is not particularly difficult, but we were then to link these libraries to an assembly project. That assembly code would then use C functions to call the Lua API, which would then return the results of those functions back to the assembly code. In all honesty, I'm not entirely sure what each step was. This was a project that was dumped on us near the end of the term with only minimal explanation. It was a miracle that I finished it at all.

Overall, this was a very interesting class. It definitely helped me develop an understanding of assmelby code and what exactly happens when C and C++ code is compiled.

## Final Grade
I received an A in this course.
